# Hello, I'm Michael Williams! 👋

I'm a Data Science and Mathematics major at the University of Michigan.

## About Me

- 🎓 Currently pursuing a degree in Data Science and Mathematics.
- 💻 Passionate about coding, data analysis, and machine learning.
- 📊 Interested in exploring the intersection of data science and mathematics to solve real-world problems.
- 🌱 Always eager to learn and improve my skills.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- [Optimizing IBM Hiring](https://github.com/micdwill/IBM-Hiring): Engineered a variable to represent the quality of a worker. Then utilized stacked decision tree with SVM, KNN, and ANN in to predict both quality and odds of attrition to select ideal hires for IBM.
- [NHANES Socioeconmic Disaprities Predictors](https://github.com/micdwill/NHANES-Socioeconomic-Predictors): Leveraged and preprocessed NHANES dataset for an analysis of U.S. economic standing, employing LASSO Regression with K-fold Cross Validation to eliminate non-influential predictors before running a Random Forest Model to find predictors for household income levels
