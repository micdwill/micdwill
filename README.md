# Hello, I'm Michael Williams! üëã


## About Me

- üéì Currently pursuing a degree in Data Science and Mathematics at the University of Michigan „ÄΩÔ∏è.
- üíª Passionate about coding, data analysis, and machine learning, with a keen interest in software engineering and development.
- üìä Enthusiastic about exploring the intersection of data science, mathematics, and software engineering to tackle real-world challenges.
- üå± Continuously seeking opportunities to broaden my knowledge and enhance my skills across various domains.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- [Natural Selection Simulator/Game](https://github.com/micdwill/Evolution-Simulator): Simulates the evolution of creatures and food sources, modeling interactions such as natural selection, predation, reproduction, and competition for resources. Frontend is done in C++. Backend is in Javascript, CSS, and HTML, and uses Node.js and Express.js as an API. A user interface is created and simulation results are displayed, along with a scoring system with high scores tracked. Includes detailed statistics generation and Python scripts for population dynamics graphs.
- [Rossman Sales Forecasting](https://github.com/micdwill/Sales-Forecasting): This project uses LSTM neural networks in a time series model to predict sales for Rossmann stores, incorporating techniques like early stopping and RMSE evaluation to ensure accuracy. Through data analysis and model development, it aims to optimize retail strategies and resource allocation for Rossmann.
- [Optimizing IBM Hiring](https://github.com/micdwill/IBM-Hiring): Engineered a variable to represent the quality of a worker. Then utilized stacked decision tree with SVM, KNN, and ANN in to predict both quality and odds of attrition to select ideal hires for IBM.
- [NHANES Socioeconomic Disaprity Predictors](https://github.com/micdwill/NHANES-Socioeconomic-Predictors): Leveraged and preprocessed NHANES dataset for an analysis of U.S. economic standing, employing LASSO Regression with K-fold Cross Validation to eliminate non-influential predictors before running a Random Forest Model to find predictors for household income levels
- [TSP Heuristic & Optimization](https://github.com/micdwill/TSP-Heuristic-and-Optimization): Implemented TSP optimization using Branch and Bound algorithm, utilizing MST to find promising branches Leveraged an Arbitrary Insertion TSP heuristic for an O(n2) algorithm with a path length within 1.5x optimal
